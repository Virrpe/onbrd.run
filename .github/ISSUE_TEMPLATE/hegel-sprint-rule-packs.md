# Hegel Sprint Track D: Rule Packs

## Overview
Implement static rule packs to organize existing probes into themed groups, allowing users to run focused audits without adding new probe logic.

## Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Create `/api/v1/rules/custom` endpoint
- [ ] Return three static rule packs:
  - **Accessibility+**: Focus on WCAG compliance and inclusive design
  - **Performance+**: Focus on load times and Core Web Vitals
  - **Trust+**: Focus on user confidence and professional appearance

### Rule Pack Structure
```json
{
  "packs": [
    {
      "id": "accessibility",
      "title": "Accessibility+",
      "probeIds": ["a11yFocus", "colorContrast", "keyboardNav", "screenReader"]
    },
    {
      "id": "performance",
      "title": "Performance+",
      "probeIds": ["lcp", "fid", "cls", "resourceOptimization"]
    },
    {
      "id": "trust",
      "title": "Trust+",
      "probeIds": ["ssl", "privacyPolicy", "contactInfo", "socialProof"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Add rule pack toggle UI in demo interface
- [ ] Feature-flagged: `RULE_PACKS_BETA`
- [ ] URL parameter support: `?pack=accessibility|performance|trust`
- [ ] Dropdown or toggle buttons for pack selection
- [ ] Default to "All Probes" when no pack selected

### Probe Mapping
- [ ] Map existing probes to appropriate packs
- [ ] Ensure no duplicate probes across packs
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with current behavior
- [ ] Document probe-to-pack assignments

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Clean toggle interface matching current design
- [ ] Clear pack descriptions
- [ ] Visual indication of selected pack
- [ ] Responsive design maintained

## Technical Constraints
- No new probe logic - only reorganization
- Feature-flagged visibility (dev/preview only)
- Maintain MV3 invariants
- Keep existing probe functionality intact
- Coverage thresholds maintained

## Database/Storage
- [ ] No database changes required
- [ ] Static configuration in code
- [ ] Easy to modify pack compositions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All three rule packs return correct probe IDs
- [ ] UI toggle allows pack selection
- [ ] URL parameter works correctly
- [ ] Feature flag controls visibility
- [ ] Existing probes run when pack selected
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] PR: `feat/probe-rule-packs`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] CI pipeline green
- [ ] UI/UX review completed
- [ ] Feature flag documented
- [ ] Probe mapping documented
