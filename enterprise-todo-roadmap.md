# Enterprise Readiness TODO Roadmap

## âœ… Completed in This Refactor

- [x] **Core Logic Refactoring** - Removed duplication between probes.ts and scoring.ts

- [x] **Enterprise API Stubs** - Created 10 new API endpoints with 501 responses
- [x] **Unit Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage for scoring.ts and probes.ts
- [x] **Integration Tests** - API stub validation confirming 501 responses
- [x] **CI/CD Enhancement** - Added test coverage enforcement (80% threshold)
- [x] **Backwards Compatibility** - No breaking changes to existing API consumers
