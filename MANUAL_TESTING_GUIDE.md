[OA][BG] inject ok →
[OA][BG] ping ok →
[OA][CS] RUN start →
[OA][CS] RUN ok →
[OA][BG] result ok →
[OA][POPUP] render ok.
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. **Open DevTools Console**
   - Right-click on the extension icon → **"Inspect popup"**
   - Keep this console open to monitor logs

2. **Test on Linear.app**
   - Open https://linear.app in a new tab
   - Click the extension icon to open popup

4. ✅ File should download with formatted report

### 5. Test Multiple Websites

**Test Sites (as specified):**
- ✅ https://linear.app
- ✅ https://calendly.com  
- ✅ https://notion.so

**Validation for Each Site:**
- Audit completes within 30 seconds
- All 5 heuristics are evaluated
- Overall score is reasonable (0-100)
- At least 1 recommendation is provided
- Export functionality works

### Manifest Validation
- ✅ Service worker configured correctly
- ✅ No content_scripts block (programmatic injection)
- ✅ No .ts references in built manifest
- ✅ No forbidden API calls in service worker

## Pass Criteria Summary

### ✅ Must Pass
- [ ] Extension builds successfully (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] Extension loads in Chrome without errors
- [ ] Expected log flow appears in console
- [ ] Audit completes on test websites
- [ ] Popup never "chokes" - shows success or error within 5s
- [ ] Export functionality works (JSON/HTML)

### ✅ Should Pass
- [ ] All 5 heuristics are evaluated
- [ ] Scores are in valid range (0-100)
- [ ] Recommendations are generated
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Multiple websites can be audited

### ❌ Known Limitations
- Playwright automated testing fails (environment issue)
- Manual testing required for full verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Extension won't load**: Check `extension/dist` exists and contains manifest.json
2. **No logs appear**: Ensure you're inspecting the correct console (popup vs background)
3. **Audit hangs**: Check browser console for content script errors
4. **Export fails**: Verify file system permissions and download settings

### Debug Information
- Extension ID: Check `chrome://extensions/` after loading
- Background logs: Right-click extension → "Inspect service worker"
- Content logs: Use target website's DevTools console

## Final Verification

After completing manual testing, the extension is ready for use if:
1. ✅ All pass criteria are met
2. ✅ No critical errors occur during testing
3. ✅ Extension remains stable across multiple test runs
4. ✅ Error handling works as expected

**Status**: Ready for manual testing ✅
